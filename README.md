# Relief_Tracker
This repository is for the code I have set up to enable the @Relief_Tracker.  It includes

5 Data Tables
<br>*1 Table for disaster information (name of event, date of event, tweet syntax columns, and hashtags) 
<br>2 Tables for common and uncommon charity tweet information
<br>2 Tables for tweet syntaxâ€™s
<br>1 table with twitter API information (which I will not be posting)
<br>1 R script that runs the whole process!*
<br>Commented out for easy of understanding!

To make this code run daily, I have setup crontab querries to run during certain parts of the day.
