# Relief_Tracker
This repository is for the code I have set up to enable the @Relief_Tracker.  It includes

5 Data Tables
*1 Table for disaster information (name of event, date of event, tweet syntax columns, and hashtags) 
2 Tables for common and uncommon charity tweet information
2 Tables for tweet syntaxâ€™s
1 table with twitter API information (which I will not be posting)
1 R script that runs the whole process!*
Commented out for easy of understanding!

To make this code run daily, I have setup crontab querries to run during certain parts of the day.
